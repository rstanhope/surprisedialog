      <strong>Key information about this research study:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information
      that is more detailed is listed later on in this form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people perceive speech in English. You will be
      asked to do tasks involving English sentences, such as listening to sentences from an audio recording and rating
      how surprised the speaker sounds. We expect that you will be in this research study for no longer than 60 minutes.
      The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in daily life. There
      are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study, but this study may benefit society if the results
      lead to a better understanding of how people perceive speech.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</strong></p>
    <p>We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are 18 to 65 years old and are a native speaker
      of English.</p>


    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>How many people will be in this study?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We expect about 260 people will be in this research study.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What should I know about participating in a research study?</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
      <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
      <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
      <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>What happens if I say, "Yes, I want to be in this research"?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The research study involves a single session which will last no longer than 60 minutes. You will be asked to
      perform a task involving listening to and comprehending sentences. The sentences will be presented to you
      auditorily through headphones. You will be asked to rate how surprised the speaker sounds, and to respond with
      your judgment as quickly and as accurately as possible. You will indicate your response with a scale presented on
      the screen. Between each trial you will be asked to count up aloud by 2s starting from a number displayed on the
      screen. Your responses and the time it takes you to respond will be aggregated with responses and response times
      from other participants and analyzed for each sentence. Your counting aloud will be recorded and checked to ensure
      that you followed instructions but will not be further analyzed or retained.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Will being in this study help me in any way?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, this study may
      benefit society if the results lead to a better understanding of how people perceive speech.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This study presents participants with no more than everyday risks. You are free to withdraw at any time, and data
      from participants who withdraw before completing the experiment will not be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What happens if I do not want to be in this research, or I change my
        mind later?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate. If you do not want to
      be in this study or withdraw from the study at any point, your decision will not affect your relationship with
      Northwestern University. If you are participating in this experiment through the Linguistics Subject Pool and you
      withdraw from the study immediately upon commencing the study procedures, you will not receive Linguistics class
      credit. You may participate in another research study or attend one of two video showings throughout the quarter
      to receive course credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you decide to withdraw from this study, any data already collected from you will be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How will the researchers protect my information?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other
      researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you
      from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Who will have access to the information collected during this research
        study?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study
      records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are reasons why information about you may be used or seen by other people beyond the research team during or
      after this study. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>University officials, government officials, study funders, auditors, and the Institutional Review Board may
        need access to the study information to make sure the study is done in a safe and appropriate manner.</li>
      <li>The research team may give information to appropriate authorities for reasons of health and safety – for
        example, if you indicate that you plan to harm yourself or others, or for public health reasons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>How might the information collected in this study be shared in the
        future?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will keep the information we collect about you during this research study for study recordkeeping and for
      potential use in future research projects. De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research
      community, with journals in which study results are published, and with databases and data repositories used for
      research. We will remove or code any personal information that could directly identify you before the study data
      are shared. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of this study could be shared in articles and presentations, but will not include any information that
      identifies you unless you give permission for use of information that identifies you in articles and
      presentations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants recruited through the Linguistics Subject Pool will receive 1 credit towards fulfillment of the
      Linguistics class experimental requirement on completion of this experiment. Note that course credit is awarded
      for participation in the experiment, meaning that you must complete the consent process and begin the study. If
      you do not consent to participate in this experiment, you may sign up for a different study or a video showing to
      fulfill your experimental requirement.
